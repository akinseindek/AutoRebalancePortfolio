AutoRebalancePortfolio
======================

A comprehensive Clarity smart contract designed to manage a multi-token portfolio, ensuring **automatic rebalancing** to maintain predetermined target allocations. This contract allows users to deposit funds in exchange for portfolio shares and includes robust owner-only functions for portfolio management and emergency pausing.

* * * * *

üöÄ Overview
-----------

The `AutoRebalancePortfolio` contract acts as a decentralized fund manager. It accepts deposits and issues shares based on the portfolio's net asset value (NAV). Its core utility is the `rebalance-portfolio` function, which is protected by a deviation threshold and a block-height cooldown period. When triggered, the function checks the current allocation of each token against its target and virtually adjusts the balances to bring the portfolio back into alignment.

***Note**: This is a simplified model. In a production environment, the `update-portfolio-value` and `get-token-value` functions would integrate with **decentralized price oracles** to accurately reflect the real-time, external value of the token holdings, and the rebalancing would involve actual token swaps (e.g., using a decentralized exchange contract).*

üõ†Ô∏è Contract Details
--------------------

### **Constants**

| Constant Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract-owner` | `tx-sender` | The principal that deployed the contract. |
| `max-tokens` | `u10` | Maximum number of tokens the portfolio can hold. |
| `percentage-base` | `u10000` | Defines 100.00% for basis point calculations (100.00% = 10,000 basis points). |
| `rebalance-threshold` | `u200` | The deviation (200 basis points or 2.00%) required to trigger a rebalance. |
| `err-owner-only` | `u100` | Returned when a function is called by a non-owner. |
| `err-rebalance-threshold` | `u107` | Rebalancing cooldown period has not elapsed or deviation is too low. |

### **Data Variables and Maps**

| Type | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`define-map`** | `portfolio-tokens` | Tracks the contract, target allocation, balance, and status of each token by a unique `token-id`. |
| **`define-map`** | `user-shares` | Stores the number of portfolio shares held by each user principal. |
| **`define-data-var`** | `total-portfolio-value` | The total value of all tokens held by the portfolio (Simplified: sum of all current-balances). |
| **`define-data-var`** | `total-shares` | The total supply of portfolio shares issued to users. |
| **`define-data-var`** | `last-rebalance-block` | The block height of the last successful rebalance operation, used for the cooldown. |
| **`define-data-var`** | `is-paused` | Boolean flag to globally pause and prevent critical functions (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `rebalance-portfolio`). |

üîë Public Functions (API)
-------------------------

### **Administrator/Owner Functions**

#### `add-token`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (add-token (token-id uint) (token-contract principal) (target-percentage uint))

```

Adds a new token to the portfolio with a starting target allocation.

-   **Authorization:** Must be called by the `contract-owner`.

-   **Pre-conditions:**

    -   `token-id` must not already exist.

    -   `token-count` must be less than `max-tokens` (`u10`).

    -   `target-percentage` must be `<= percentage-base` (`u10000`).

#### `update-target-allocation`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (update-target-allocation (token-id uint) (new-percentage uint))

```

Modifies the target allocation for an existing token in the portfolio.

-   **Authorization:** Must be called by the `contract-owner`.

-   **Pre-conditions:**

    -   `token-id` must exist and be active.

    -   `new-percentage` must be `<= percentage-base` (`u10000`). ***Note:** This contract does not enforce that the *sum* of all active target allocations equals 100% (`u10000`). The owner is responsible for managing the allocations to ensure they sum correctly. The private `validate-total-allocation` function is included but not used in the public API, suggesting it's reserved for internal use or future implementation.*

#### `pause-portfolio`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (pause-portfolio (pause bool))

```

Allows the owner to pause or unpause critical portfolio operations (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `rebalance-portfolio`). This is a **security failsafe**.

-   **Authorization:** Must be called by the `contract-owner`.

### **User Functions**

#### `deposit`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (deposit (amount uint))

```

Deposits funds into the portfolio and issues portfolio shares to the user.

-   **Logic:**

    -   If `total-portfolio-value` is `u0` (first deposit), shares are issued 1:1 with the deposit amount.

    -   Otherwise, shares are calculated based on the current NAV (Net Asset Value) per share:

        SharesIssued=TotalPortfolioValueDepositAmount√óTotalShares‚Äã

-   **Pre-conditions:**

    -   Portfolio must **not** be paused (`is-paused` must be `false`).

    -   `amount` must be greater than `u0`.

-   **Post-conditions:** Updates `user-shares`, `total-shares`, and `total-portfolio-value`.

#### `withdraw`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (withdraw (shares-amount uint))

```

Redeems portfolio shares for an equivalent withdrawal amount from the portfolio.

-   **Logic:** The withdrawal amount is calculated based on the user's share of the total portfolio value:

    WithdrawalAmount=TotalSharesSharesRedeemed√óTotalPortfolioValue‚Äã

-   **Pre-conditions:**

    -   Portfolio must **not** be paused (`is-paused` must be `false`).

    -   `shares-amount` must be less than or equal to the user's share balance.

-   **Post-conditions:** Updates `user-shares`, `total-shares`, and `total-portfolio-value`.

### **Core Rebalancing Function**

#### `rebalance-portfolio`

Code snippet

```
(define-public (rebalance-portfolio))

```

The central mechanism for automated portfolio rebalancing.

-   **Process:**

    1.  **Security/Pause Check:** Ensures the contract is not paused.

    2.  **Cooldown Check:** Asserts that at least `u144` blocks (approx. 1 day) have passed since the `last-rebalance-block`.

    3.  **Deviation Check:** Iterates through all active tokens, calculates the percentage deviation of their `current-balance` from their `target-percentage` using `calculate-deviation`.

    4.  **Threshold Enforcement:** Asserts that the `max-deviation` found is `>= rebalance-threshold` (`u200` or 2.00%).

    5.  **Execution:** If the threshold is met, it calls `check-and-rebalance-token` for each token.

        -   For tokens above or below the target allocation by the threshold, their `current-balance` is *virtually* updated in the `portfolio-tokens` map to match the `target-value`.

    6.  **Value Update:** Calls `update-portfolio-value` to recalculate the new `total-portfolio-value` after the virtual adjustments.

    7.  **Timestamp:** Updates `last-rebalance-block` to `block-height`.

| `(check-max-deviation (token-id uint) (current-max uint))` | Used by `fold` in `rebalance-portfolio` to find the largest percentage deviation among all active tokens. |
| `(check-and-rebalance-token (token-id uint))` | Performs the core rebalancing adjustment for an individual token by setting its `current-balance` to the calculated `target-value` if the deviation threshold is met. |
